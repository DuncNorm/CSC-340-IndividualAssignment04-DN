# CSC-340-IndividualAssignment04-DN

This is my submission for our Individual Assignment 04, I have only modified the "User" Java and HTML files.
Instead of adding users to our site, the site now resembles a friends list on Steam, Xbox, Playstation, etc.
You can add you friend by their gamertag, email, and a new gamerscore as well as delete and modify them by clicking on their ID.
